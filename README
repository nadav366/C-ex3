The exercise involved writing a mathematical library and the software that it uses,
so I will address the two separately.

libinfi Library-
We are given a header file, which we have implemented the functions defined therein.
Overall the majority was very simple and immediate - to write according to the exact
 mathematical guidelines given to us.
During the realization of the function, it is invoked by asserting invalid input
 and undefined actions such as-
h <0, N <0, a <b and so on.
And calling for functions with values that are not within their definition.

NumericalAnalyzer software-
The software receives user parameters and runs the respective library, most of the
 realization involved testing the variable input.
The case of h <0 was not tested in the school solution, so I also did not check it even
though it seems to be an incorrect input.
